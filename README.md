    * inheritnce
      > Inheritance is a comprehensive succession of property and status by the death of a person. It is stated in Wikipedia. If so, is the meaning of inheritance in Java much different from what is stated in the encyclopedia? no. It is similar. Just as a child inherits physical property or intellectual property inherited from a parent in the real world, a child class inherited from a parent class in Java has all the resources and methods of the parent class You can use it as your own.
